<h1>Underground Trees - a general-purpose tree library</h1>
<h4>A new tree library</h4>
<p>
Underground trees is a new tree library.
It&apos;s the latest result of our long lasting interest in tree libraries,
which dates back many years (including previous implementations from 2001 and 2003).
Relative to other tree libraries, this library is more general, flexible, and
in our opinion, elegant. There are very few assumptions and restrictions.
</p>

<p>
An important achievement is, that this design lends itself for implementations
of more specific types of trees.
</p>



<h4>The basics</h4>
<p>
<!-- This implementation requires inheriting a class from a tree template.
By specifying the class in the template parameters, the library gets the type it will use
for the members stored, and the function arguments and return values. -->
For users there is only one class they define and use, and that class can store
members and functions, and that class is also the return type from the basic functions.
This provides the library users clarity and simplicity.
</p>

<p>
Iterators are clear and simple, and go a long way past the iterators
available in some other tree libraries.
</p>

<p>
    NULL children are suppported.
</p>

<p>
A flexible handling of arrays through an array interface that allows steering away from those of STL.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

In the example below a tree class is defined. The definition is by inheritance.
A few points worth noticing:
<ul>
<li>
  The example uses the derived class, not the library&apos;s base class!
</li>
<li>
  The derived class can add members and functions, and also over-ride functions
  from the base class, as they use the same type, that of the derived class.
</li>
<li>
  Iterators are simple, and the use is simplified even further with a macro.
</li>
<li>
  Null children are supported.
</li>
</ul>

// In this example a new class adds several methods, and a value DM.
// Then the methods are used interchangeably with the methods derived from the base class.

<h4>Difficulties addressed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Good interface
</li>
<li>
Good iterators
</li>
<li>
Flexibility in class design, and tree management
</li>
<li>
Support for NULL leaves
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Difficulties not addressed</h4>
<ul>
<!-- li>
  Non const iterators: It would be desirable for const and non-const (NC) iterators to
  share their common parts (i.e. identify the large commonality and implement just once).
  This is not the state of the current implementation.
  Other designs that seemed more elegant to start with,
  and relied on larger common parts, appeared lacking when diving deeper.
  The main problem was, that it seemed unavoidable to require somwhere
  an assignment of the type const=NC.
</li -->

<li>
  Inheriting from a template derived from the tree template is not a problem.
  Inheriting from an instance class derived from a template is a different story.
<br />
  The process for inheriting from an instance class tree derived from Underground Trees
  loses some elegance, as that inherited class will not get
  the same level of simplicity and elegance. The reason is that
  the type of each tree item remains the type of the first derivation.
<br />
  The second derivation
  will contain a lot of casting, some of it, possibly, dynamic.
  Unless, as mentioned above, the derivation remains from a template.
</li>

</ul>

<h4>Parametric Array type</h4>
We&apos;ve made the basic array (i.e. the storage type
for children and iterator state) parametric.
This way different array implementations can be used.
<br />
As ours, our favorite, is lacking relative to STL in several criteria,
an STL implementation of the array interface is provided.
