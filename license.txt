1. This document
The Underground Trees project and distribution is binded by the
LGPL license, with an addition specified below (see 5.2).
The license LGPL, is long and cumbersome, clearly written by lawyers.
Here we attempt to simplify, and explain the essence of the license
in a form readable by non-lawyers, and add clause 5.2.
The terms of this document are written by non-lawyers, for the sake
of introduction and explanation. The LGPL license then elaborates
this in legalese.
The clause 5.2 doesn't appear in the LGPL license. In all other
matters, the LGPL license has precedence in case the LGPL license
happens to conflict with this document.

2. The essence of the license
The purpose of the license is to keep the distribution, and the distribution only,
open source. The distribution of a product that uses Underground Trees (as well as
re-distribution of the original, either with or without changes), should also
include what the Underground Trees distribution includes:
1- The LGPL license (pertaining only to Underground Trees, not the whole product
   distribution, as opposed to GPL which mandates this on the whole product)
   and its basis, the GPL license.
2- This license document, containing additions and explanations.
3- The Underground Trees source code, as it's used in the distributed product (or
   the original Underground Trees, in case it wasn't changed for the product).
4- A specification of the changes made to Underground Trees from its original
   distribution.
The terms of the license will bind the receivers of the distribution in case they
wish to distribute Underground Trees (with or without changes) further. The
terms in the re-distribution must also follow those in the distribution, including
binding the receivers by the license, thus including this responsibility to transfer
the license and the terms in the distribution, upon subsequent re-distributions.
